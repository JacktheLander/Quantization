The light goes off but it does on a few moments later as I take over in my role as substitute teacher to the class of the day with my own class that is going from 25 kids down so they are now only getting about fifteen or sixteen for half days which has been the case ever since we went back during August Break last year when we had two weeks then a week before Christmas break where there was no school because everybody else just took time out like all schools did across Ontario even though most people didn't want them gone anyway especially if you have your own businesses doing what everyone wants more than anything these days whether its a bakery catering service or a massage parlour which is what lots do any"}]
